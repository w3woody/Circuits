# Circuits

This repository contains the [Eagle](https://www.autodesk.com/products/eagle/free-download) files and [iCircuit](https://icircuitapp.com) files for the various circuits designed on [The Hacking Den](https://hackingden.com).

Note that many of the circuits are designed to fit on a two-layer board and fit in a 100mm x 100mm board--which fits within the specifications for inexpensive circuit board manufacturing by [Seeed Studio](https://www.seeedstudio.com/fusion_pcb.html).
